# BBF report tool CWMP index page configuration file (htmlbbf report type)
#
# Summary:
#   This configuration file is read by the BBF report tool when
#   generating the CWMP index page using the htmlbbf report type.
#
#   Notes within the body of the file explain and illustrate the
#   syntax, which is similar to that of a Windows "ini" file.  Also
#   see:
#   http://search.cpan.org/~wadg/Config-IniFiles-2.38/IniFiles.pm#FILE_FORMAT
#   (the -allowcontinue option is assumed to be set) 
#
#   To generate the CWMP index page, the command is something like
#   this:
#
#   report.exe --configfile=<this-file> --report=htmlbbf \
#   <all-xml-schemas> <all-dm-instances> --outfile=<something>.html
#
#   The order in which the XML Schemas and DM Instances are specified
#   does not matter.  The generated web page will include details of
#   all files that are imported by the specified files, so in fact it
#   is not necessary to specify _everything_.  However, it does no
#   harm.
#
#   In an ideal world, this file would not be needed, because all the
#   relevant information would be extracted from the DM Instances.
#   This is not yet the case...
#
#   This file is maintained by the BroadbandHome Working Group as
#   OD-148.
#
#  Revision History:
#    January 2012: OD-148_Rev-12.txt:
#      * Initial version of config file
#    February 2012: OD-148_Rev-13.txt:
#      * Removed reference to never-released tr-143-1-0-0.xml
#    November 2013: OD-148_Rev-14.txt:
#      * Added entry for cwmp-datamodel-1-5.xsd
#      * Added entry for cwmp-devicetype-1-2.xsd and cwmp-devicetype-1-3.xsd
#      * Added entries for tr-157-1-6.xml (and corresponding root data models)
#      * Added entries for tr-157-1-7.xml (and corresponding root data models)
#      * Removed entry for tr-196-2-0-1.xml, because it now uses the new OD-290
#        templates
#      * Removed "i-a-c" from tr-106-1-0-0-types.xml (to support corrigenda)
#    January 2014: OD-148_Rev-15.txt:
#      * Added entries for TR-069a5: cwmp-1-4.xsd, cwmp-UDPLightweight-
#        Notification-1-0.xsd and cwmp-xmppConnReq-1-0.xsd, tr-157-1-8-0.xml,
#        tr-098-1-7-0.xml, tr-181-1-5-0.xml

#      * Updated entries for support files
#    January 2014: OD-148_Rev-16.txt:
#      * Corrected / completed support file history
#    April 2014: OD-148_Rev-17.txt:
#      * Added introductory text from contribution bbf2014.229.00
#      * Changed pubdate (publication date) to appdate (approval date)
#      * Added entries for TR-104a2: tr-104-2-0-0.xml
#    June 2014: OD-148_Rev-18:
#      * Minor changes to introductory text following feedback
#      * Fixed various approval dates per Secretariat feedback
#      * Added IL-181 "Document" column entry
#      * Added explicit corrigendum numbers for all data model files except
#        for tr-196-2-0 (it's too easy inadvertently to pick up information
#        from XML files)
#    September 2014: OD-148_Rev-19:
#      * Cosmetic changes to introductory text
#      * Added entries for tr-157-1-9, tr-181-1-6, tr-098-1-8 and tr-181-2-8
#    September 2014: OD-148_Rev-20:

intro = <<.
The Broadband Forum defines several data models for use with the CPE WAN Management Protocol ({{trref|TR-069 Amendment 5}}).  These data models contain objects and parameters that describe the many different functions and capabilities available to devices and services that are manageable via CWMP.
CWMP data models are divided into two types: ''Root'' and ''Service''.  The root data model, ''Device''{{footnote|Early versions of the CWMP data model defined two root data models, ''InternetGatewayDevice'' and ''Device''.  Version 2 of the ''Device'' root data model (''Device:2'') deprecates ''InternetGatewayDevice'' and ''Device:1'' in favor of a single root data model.}}, is used to describe the major functions of a network aware device, including interfaces, software/firmware, diagnostics, components common to CWMP and other services, and the basic device information necessary to CWMP.
Service data models describe modular functionality that allow the extension of the root data model on a device (under ''Device.Services.'') to provide particular services, such as a voice service, set top box service, network attached storage, etc.
Each data model is defined by a ''Name:Version'' syntax. A device defines its data model by defining a [file://#TR-069%20Device%20Type%20Schema%20%28DT%20Schema%29 device type], an XML document that maps to (imports) BBF official data model objects and/or vendor specific objects. A full explanation of how to develop compliant CWMP data models can be found in {{trref|TR-154}}.

# remaining entries are file names; values can come from two places,
# with the following priority:
#   1. taken from this file
#   2. extracted from the XSD / XML
#
# this means that this file can override a value extracted from the XSD / XML,
# but if this happens, the report tool will issue a warning, because this is
# likely to be unintentional (we want to move towards taking all values from
# the XSD / XML and rendering this config file unnecessary)

# each file provides a document name (not needed for data models), TR name
# (tr-nnn-i-a[-c]), publication date (yyyy-mm) and description
#
#   if no TR corresponds to the file (because it wasn't updated when the file
#   was published), it is omitted
