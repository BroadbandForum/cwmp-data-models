# OD-148_Rev-21+.txt (CWMP version)
#
# BBF report tool CWMP index page configuration file (htmlbbf report type)
#
# Summary:
#   This configuration file is read by the BBF report tool when
#   generating the CWMP index page using the htmlbbf report type.
#
#   Notes within the body of the file explain and illustrate the
#   syntax, which is similar to that of a Windows "ini" file.  Also
#   see:
#   http://search.cpan.org/~wadg/Config-IniFiles-2.38/IniFiles.pm#FILE_FORMAT
#   (the -allowcontinue option is assumed to be set)
#
#   To generate the CWMP index page, the command is something like
#   this:
#
#   report.exe --configfile=<this-file> --report=htmlbbf \
#   <all-xml-schemas> <all-dm-instances> --outfile=<something>.html
#
#   The order in which the XML Schemas and DM Instances are specified
#   does not matter.  The generated web page will include details of
#   all files that are imported by the specified files, so in fact it
#   is not necessary to specify _everything_.  However, it does no
#   harm.
#
#   In an ideal world, this file would not be needed, because all the
#   relevant information would be extracted from the DM Instances.
#   This is not yet the case...
#
#   This file is maintained by the BroadbandHome Working Group as
#   OD-148.
#
#  Revision History:
#    January 2012: OD-148_Rev-12.txt:
#      * Initial version of config file
#    February 2012: OD-148_Rev-13.txt:
#      * Removed reference to never-released tr-143-1-0-0.xml
#    November 2013: OD-148_Rev-14.txt:

#      * Added entries for tr-157-1-7.xml (and corresponding root data models)
#      * Removed entry for tr-196-2-0-1.xml, because it now uses the new OD-290
#        templates
#      * Removed "i-a-c" from tr-106-1-0-0-types.xml (to support corrigenda)
#    January 2014: OD-148_Rev-15.txt:
#      * Added entries for TR-069a5: cwmp-1-4.xsd, cwmp-UDPLightweight-
#        Notification-1-0.xsd and cwmp-xmppConnReq-1-0.xsd, tr-157-1-8-0.xml,
#        tr-098-1-7-0.xml, tr-181-1-5-0.xml

#    January 2014: OD-148_Rev-16.txt:
#      * Corrected / completed support file history
#    April 2014: OD-148_Rev-17.txt:
#      * Added introductory text from contribution bbf2014.229.00
#      * Changed pubdate (publication date) to appdate (approval date)
#      * Added entries for TR-104a2: tr-104-2-0-0.xml
#    June 2014: OD-148_Rev-18:
#      * Minor changes to introductory text following feedback
#      * Fixed various approval dates per Secretariat feedback
#      * Added IL-181 "Document" column entry
#      * Added explicit corrigendum numbers for all data model files except
#        for tr-196-2-0 (it's too easy inadvertently to pick up information
#        from XML files)
#    September 2014: OD-148_Rev-19:
#      * Cosmetic changes to introductory text
#      * Added entries for tr-157-1-9, tr-181-1-6, tr-098-1-8 and tr-181-2-8
#    September 2014: OD-148_Rev-20:
#      * Added reference to the CWMP Tools and Resources page to the

#      * Added support file history for versioned files (it's not in the files)
#      * Commented out tr-181-2-0-1.xml entry to work around report tool
#        problem/feature

The Broadband Forum defines several data models for use with the CPE WAN Management Protocol ({{trref|TR-069 Amendment 6}}).  These data models contain objects and parameters that describe the many different functions and capabilities available to devices and services that are manageable via CWMP.
CWMP data models are divided into two types: ''Root'' and ''Service''.  The root data model, ''Device''{{footnote|Early versions of the CWMP data model defined two root data models, ''InternetGatewayDevice'' and ''Device''.  Version 2 of the ''Device'' root data model (''Device:2'') deprecates ''InternetGatewayDevice'' and ''Device:1'' in favor of a single root data model.}}, is used to describe the major functions of a network aware device, including interfaces, software/firmware, diagnostics, components common to CWMP and other services, and the basic device information necessary to CWMP.
Service data models describe modular functionality that allow the extension of the root data model on a device (under ''Device.Services.'') to provide particular services, such as a voice service, set top box service, network attached storage, etc.
Each data model is defined by a ''Name:Version'' syntax. A device defines its data model by defining a [file://#Device%20Type%20Schema%20%28DT%20Schema%29 device type], an XML document that maps to (imports) BBF official data model objects and/or vendor specific objects. A full explanation of how to develop compliant CWMP data models can be found in {{trref|TR-154}}.

# USP (--option htmlbbf_configfile_suffix=usp)

intro-usp = <<.
The Broadband Forum defines several data models for use with the User Services Platform (USP) ({{trref|TR-369}}). These data models contain objects, parameters, commands, and events that describe the many different service elements that can be exposed via USP Agents.
USP data models are divided into two types: ''Root'' and ''Service''. The root data model, ''Device'', is used to describe the major functions of network aware devices, including interfaces, software/firmware, diagnostics, components common to USP and other services, and the basic Agent information necessary to the operation of USP.
Service data models describe modular functionality that allow the extension of the root data model on a device (under ''Device.Services.'') to provide particular services, such as a voice service, set top box service, network attached storage, smart home objects, etc.
Each data model is defined by a ''Name:Version syntax''. The objects, parameters, commands, and events that a particular Agent supports from its implementation of the data model define what is reported to Controllers via the ''GetSupportedDM'' message.

# remaining entries are file names; values can come from two places,
# with the following priority:
#   1. taken from this file
#   2. extracted from the XSD / XML
#
# this means that this file can override a value extracted from the XSD / XML,
# but if this happens, the report tool will issue a warning, because this is
# likely to be unintentional (we want to move towards taking all values from
# the XSD / XML and rendering this config file unnecessary)

# each file provides a document name (not needed for data models), TR name
# (tr-nnn-i-a[-c]), publication date (yyyy-mm) and description
#
#   if no TR corresponds to the file (because it wasn't updated when the file
#   was published), it is omitted

Converted the document to markdown and extended the Wi-Fi Theory of Operation

Split the XML into multiple smaller files (this is just housekeeping; it doesn't affect how the model is used)

Added Device.USPAgent to the CWMP model to allow a CWMP ACS to configure a device for USP communications

Added Device.Routing.Babel for the RFC 8966 Babel routing protocol

Added Device.DOCSIS for modeling DOCSIS 3.0 and 3.1 interfaces

Added Device.Users.Group, Device.Users.Role and Device.Users.SupportedShell tables for modeling system users

Improved the Wi-Fi data model by adding Data Elements R2 parameters, moving MultiAP parameters into the Data Elements structure, and by deprecating AIFSN, ECWMin, ECWMax and TxOpMax

Clarified that Device.Optical is intended for generic optical interfaces and is not intended to model anything specific to IEEE or ITU-T PON technologies (objects specific to such technologies may be added in future versions of the data model)

Clarified the meaning and usage of the Device.Ethernet.Interface and Device.Ethernet.Link objects (also allowed the Ethernet Link MACAddress parameter to be written)

Improved (and made more consistent) the marking of (and explanation of) deprecated items, and how such items should progress from being deprecated to obsoleted to deleted

Added a Baseline:4 profile that doesn't include Device.LANConfigSecurity (it relates to the now-deprecated TR-064 LAN management protocol)

Many minor improvements to object and parameter descriptions

Replaced the non-standard dmr:version attribute with the version attribute (which supports three levels of version)

Switched to DMR (data model report) schema v1.0, which supports multi-line paragraphs, and wrapped all lines to 80 characters maximum
