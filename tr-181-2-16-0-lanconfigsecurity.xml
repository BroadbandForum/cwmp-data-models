        <description>
          A password to allow LAN access to protected auto-configuration
          services.

          If the CPE supports TR-064 (LAN-side DSL CPE Configuration Protocol),
          this parameter is to be used as the ''dslf-config'' password (as
          defined in TR-064).

          If the CPE has a user interface with password protection enabled,
          this parameter is also to be used as the user password for
          password-protected operations. However, this parameter MUST NOT be
          used to set the user password if the parameter
          {{param|#.UserInterface.PasswordUserSelectable}} is {{true}}.
