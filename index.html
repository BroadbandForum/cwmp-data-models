  <h1>Broadband Forum CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP) Data Models</h1>

  <p>The Broadband Forum defines several data models for use with the CPE WAN
  Management Protocol
  (<a href="https://www.broadband-forum.org/technical/download/TR-069_Amendment-6.pdf">TR-069
  Amendment 6</a>).  These data models contain objects and parameters that
  describe the many different functions and capabilities available to devices
  and services that are manageable via CWMP.</p>

  <p>CWMP data models are divided into two types: <i>Root</i>
  and <i>Service</i>.  The root data model, <i>Device</i><sup>1</sup>, is used
  to describe the major functions of a network aware device, including
  interfaces, software/firmware, diagnostics, components common to CWMP and
  other services, and the basic device information necessary to CWMP.</p>

  <p>Service data models describe modular functionality that allow the
  extension of the root data model on a device (under <i>Device.Services.</i>)
  to provide particular services, such as a voice service, set top box service,
  network attached storage, etc.</p>

  <p>Each data model is defined by a <i>Name:Version</i> syntax. A device
  defines its data model by defining a <i>device type</i>, an XML document that
  maps to (imports) BBF official data model objects and/or vendor specific
  objects. A full explanation of how to develop compliant CWMP data models can
  be found
  in <a href="https://www.broadband-forum.org/technical/download/TR-154.pdf">TR-154</a>.</p>

  <p><sup>1</sup> Early versions of the CWMP data model defined two root data
  models, <i>InternetGatewayDevice</i> and <i>Device</i>.  Version 2 of
  the <i>Device</i> root data model (<i>Device:2</i>)
  deprecates <i>InternetGatewayDevice</i> and <i>Device:1</i> in favor of a
  single root data model.</p>

  <h2>How do I use these?</h2>

  <p>Use the CWMP data model files to define and implement what exists in your solution's
  <i>Supported Data Model</i>. This will help the ACS to learn what your
  CPE is capable of. The data models will also describe how your CPE's
  <i>Instantiated Data Model</i> will behave during operation.</p>

      model documentation.</li>
    <li>Use the XML files in this repository when generating code and performing
      data validation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These data models are the basis for the
    Broadband Forum's <a href="https://usp-data-models.broadband-forum.org">data
  models for the User Services Platform (USP)</a>.</p>
