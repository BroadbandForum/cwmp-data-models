        This table contains information about the relationships between the
        multiple layers of interface objects ({{bibref|TR-181i2|Section 4.3}}).
        In particular, it contains information on which interfaces run ''on top
        of'' which other interfaces.

        This table is auto-generated by the CPE based on the ''LowerLayers''
        parameters on individual interface objects.

        Each table row represents a "link" between two interface objects, a
        higher-layer interface object (referenced by {{param|HigherLayer}}) and
        a lower-layer interface object (referenced by {{param|LowerLayer}}).
        Consequently, if a referenced interface object is deleted, the CPE MUST
        delete the corresponding {{object}} row(s) that had referenced it.
