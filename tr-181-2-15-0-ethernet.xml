      <description>
        Ethernet statistics based on the {{bibref|RFC2819}} ''RMON-MIB''
        ''etherStatsTable'', with some extensions inspired by
        {{bibref|G.988|Section 9.3.32}}.

        Each instance is associated with an interface capable of transporting
        Ethernet-encapsulated packets, and contains a set of unidirectional
        Ethernet statistics.

        The statistics are sampled either on ingress or on egress. This is
        determined as follows:

        * If the instance is associated with an egress queue (or queues) via
          the {{param|Queue}} parameter or by setting {{param|AllQueues}} to
          {{true}} then data is sampled on egress. In this case {{param|Bytes}}
          etc measure the data that has been sent on the interface, possibly
          filtered by {{param|Queue}} or {{param|VLANID}}.

        * Otherwise data is sampled on ingress. In this case {{param|Bytes}}
          etc measure the data that has been received on the interface,
          possibly filtered by {{param|VLANID}}.

        When sampling on egress, the term ''received'' means ''received by the
        queuing sub-system''.

        Multiple instances can be associated with a single interface:
        individual instances can be configured to collect data associated with
        the entire interface, or with a particular VLAN and/or queue.

        The CPE MUST reset each instances's Stats parameters whenever the
        instance is disabled and re-enabled. Whether this reset occurs when the
        instance becomes operationally disabled ({{param|Status}} =
        {{enum|Disabled|Status}}) or administratively enabled ({{param|Enable}}
        = {{true}}) is a local matter to the CPE. This is similar to the
        behavior of interface statistics, e.g. as specified for
        {{object|Device.Ethernet.Interface.{i}.Stats}}. Furthermore, this
        instance's Stats parameters MUST be reset whenever the referenced
        interface's Stats parameters are reset, or when the referenced queue or
        VLAN is disabled and re-enabled.

        For enabled table entries, if {{param|Interface}} references an
        interface that is not capable of transporting Ethernet-encapsulated
        packets, or if {{param|Queue}} references a queue that is not
        instantiated on {{param|Interface}}, or if {{param|Queue}} is not a
        valid reference and {{param|AllQueues}} is {{false}}, the table entry
        is inoperable and the CPE MUST set {{param|Status}} to
        {{enum|Error_Misconfigured|Status}}.

        Note: The {{object}} table includes unique key parameters that are
        strong references. If a strongly referenced object is deleted, the CPE
        will set the referencing parameter to {{empty}}. However, doing so
        under these circumstances might cause the updated {{object}} row to
        then violate the table's unique key constraint; if this occurs, the CPE
        MUST set {{param|Status}} to {{enum|Error_Misconfigured|Status}} and
        disable the offending {{object}} row.
