        packet interface. A PTM Link entry is typically stacked on top of

        When a ''PTM Link'' interface is used, a lower-layer

          waiting for external actions before it can transmit and receive
          network traffic (and subsequently change to {{enum|Up}} if still
          operable when the expected actions have completed); it SHOULD change
          to {{enum|LowerLayerDown}} if and only if the interface is prevented
          from entering the {{enum|Up}} state because one or more of the
          interfaces beneath it is down; it SHOULD remain in the {{enum|Error}}
          state if there is an error or other fault condition detected on the
          interface; it SHOULD remain in the {{enum|NotPresent}} state if the
          interface has missing (typically hardware) components; it SHOULD
          change to {{enum|Unknown}} if the state of the interface can not be
          determined for some reason.

        interface becomes operationally down due to a previous administrative
        down (i.e. the interface's {{param|#.Status}} parameter transitions to
        a down state after the interface is disabled) or when the interface
        becomes administratively up (i.e. the interface's {{param|#.Enable}}
        parameter transitions from {{false}} to {{true}}). Administrative and
        operational interface status is discussed in {{bibref|TR-181i2|section
