  <dataType name="DiagnosticsState">
    <description>
      Indicates the availability of diagnostics data. Enumeration of:

      {{enum}}

      If the ACS sets the value of this parameter to {{enum|Requested}}, the
      CPE MUST initiate the corresponding diagnostic test. When writing, the
      only allowed values are {{enum|Requested}} and {{enum|Canceled}}. To
      ensure the use of the proper test parameters (the writable parameters in
      this object), the test parameters MUST be set, and any errors or
      inconsistencies in the test parameters MUST be detected, either prior to
      or at the same time as (in the same SetParameterValues) setting this
      parameter to {{enum|Requested}}.

      When requested, the CPE SHOULD wait until after completion of the
      communication session with the ACS before starting the diagnostic test.

      When the test is completed, the value of this parameter MUST be either
      {{enum|Complete}} (if the test completed successfully), or one of the
      ''Error'' values listed above.

      If the value of this parameter is anything other than {{enum|Complete}},
      the values of the results parameters for this test are indeterminate.

      When the diagnostic initiated by the ACS is completed (successfully or
      not), but not if it is canceled for any reason, the CPE MUST establish a
      new connection to the ACS to allow the ACS to view the results,
      indicating the Event code ''8 DIAGNOSTICS COMPLETE'' in the Inform
      message.

      After the diagnostic is complete, the value of all result parameters (all
      read-only parameters in this object) MUST be retained by the CPE until
      either this diagnostic is run again, or the CPE reboots. After a reboot,
      if the CPE has not retained the result parameters from the most recent
      test, it MUST set the value of this parameter to {{enum|None}}.

      Modifying any of the writable parameters in this object except for this
      one MUST result in the value of this parameter being set to
      {{enum|None}}.

      While the test is in progress, modifying any of the writable parameters
      in this object except for this one MUST result in the test being
      terminated and the value of this parameter being set to {{enum|None}}.

      While the test is in progress, setting this parameter to
      {{enum|Requested}} (and possibly modifying other writable parameters in
      this object) MUST result in the test being terminated and then restarted
      using the current values of the test parameters.

      While the test is in progress, setting this parameter to
      {{enum|Canceled}} MUST result in the test being canceled and the value of
      this parameter being set to {{enum|None}}. If the CPE does not support
      the {{enum|Canceled}} value, it MUST return a SPV error with "Invalid
      Parameter value" (9007) to the ACS instead.

  <dataType name="IPAddress">
    <description>
      IP address, i.e. IPv4 address (or IPv4 subnet mask) or IPv6 address.

      All IPv4 addresses and subnet masks MUST be represented as strings in
      IPv4 dotted-decimal notation. Here are some examples of valid IPv4
      address textual representations:

      * 216.52.29.100

      * 192.168.1.254

      All IPv6 addresses MUST be represented using any of the 3 standard
      textual representations defined in {{bibref|RFC4291}} Sections 2.2.1,
      2.2.2 and 2.2.3. Both lower-case and upper-case letters can be used, but
      use of lower-case letters is RECOMMENDED. Here are some examples of valid
      IPv6 address textual representations:

      * 1080:0:0:800:ba98:3210:11aa:12dd

      * 1080::800:ba98:3210:11aa:12dd

      * 0:0:0:0:0:0:13.1.68.3

      IPv6 addresses MUST NOT include zone identifiers. Zone identifiers are
      discussed in {{bibref|RFC4007|Section 6}}.

      Unspecified or inapplicable addresses (or IPv4 subnet masks) MUST be
      represented as empty strings unless otherwise specified by the parameter
      definition.

  <dataType name="IPPrefix">
    <description>
      IPv4 or IPv6 routing prefix in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
      notation {{bibref|RFC4632}}. This is specified as an IP address followed
      by an appended "/n" suffix, where ''n'' (the prefix size) is an integer
      in the range 0-32 (for IPv4) or 0-128 (for IPv6) that indicates the
      number of (leftmost) '1' bits of the routing prefix.

      * IPv4 example: 192.168.1.0/24

      * IPv6 example: 2001:edff:fe6a:f76::/64

      This notation can also represent individual addresses by specifying all
      bits.

      * IPv4 example: 192.168.1.1/32

      * IPv6 example: 2001:edff:fe6a:f76::1/128

      If the IP address part is unspecified or inapplicable, it MUST be
      {{empty}} unless otherwise specified by the parameter definition. In this
      case the IP prefix will be of the form "/n".

      If the entire IP prefix is unspecified or inapplicable, it MUST be
      {{empty}} unless otherwise specified by the parameter definition.

  <dataType name="StatsCounter32">
    <description>
      A 32-bit statistics parameter, e.g. a byte counter.

      This data type SHOULD NOT be used for statistics parameters whose values
      might become greater than the maximum value that can be represented as an
      ''unsignedInt'' (i.e. 0xffffffff, referred to below as ''maxval'').
      ''StatsCounter64'' SHOULD be used for such parameters.

      The value ''maxval'' indicates that no data is available for this
      parameter. In the unlikely event that the actual value of the statistic
      is ''maxval'', the CPE SHOULD return ''maxval - 1''.

      The actual value of the statistic might be greater than ''maxval''. Such
      values SHOULD wrap around through zero.

      The term ''packet'' is to be interpreted as the transmission unit
      appropriate to the protocol layer in question, e.g. an IP packet or an
      Ethernet frame.
