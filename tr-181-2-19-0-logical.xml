        Logical object. This object models several Logical interface objects,
        each representing a different stack layer, including:
        {{object|Interface}}. {{object|Interface}} is a logical interface which
        can point to other stackable interface layers.

        The intention of the logical interface is to simplify the configuration
        management of individual {{bibref|TR-181i2}} services. Instead of
        configuring the individual network services with a physical interface
        and deal with reconfiguration problems that may arise from switching
        between WAN interfaces. The intention is that the network services are
        configured with a logical interface and that this configuration stays
        unchanged during the switching between WAN interfaces. The software
        service (For example a WAN mode manger.) responsible for handling the
        WAN interface changes must then only care about rewriting the
        LowerLayers parameter of the Logical Interface Objects.
