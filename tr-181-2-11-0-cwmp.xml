          Indicates whether or not this {{object}} is enabled.
          Disabling an enabled Execution Environment stops it, while enabling a disabled Execution Environment starts it.  
          When an Execution Environment is disabled, Deployment Units installed to that Execution Environment will be unaffected, but any Execution Units currently running on that Execution Environment will automatically transition to {{enum|Idle|#.ExecutionUnit.{i}.Status}}.
          If a ChangeDUState is attempted on a {{object|#.DeploymentUnit}} that is to be applied against a disabled {{object}}, that ChangeDUState operation fails and the associated DUStateChangeComplete RPC will contain a FaultStruct for that operation.
          If a SetParameterValues is attempted against the {{param|#.ExecutionUnit.{i}.RequestedState}} for an {{object|#.ExecutionUnit}} that is associated with a disabled {{object}} a CWMP Fault will be issued in response.
          Disabling an Execution Environment could place the device in a non-manageable state.  For example, if the operating system itself was modeled as an {{object}} and the ACS disabled it, the CWMP management agent might be terminated leaving the device unmanageable.

        This object proposes a general location for vendor extensions specific to this Execution Unit, which allows multiple Execution Units to expose parameters without the concern of conflicting parameter names.  These vendor extensions are related to displaying status and maintaining configuration for this Execution Unit.
        It is also possible for the Execution Unit to expose status and configuration parameters within Service objects or as embedded objects and parameters directly within the root data model, in which case the combination of {{param|#.References}} and {{param|#.SupportedDataModelList}} will be used to determine their locations.
        See {{bibref|TR-157a3|Appendix II.3.2}} for more description and some examples.

        The M2M Area Network Device Information provides the administration capability to the SCL for maintenance of M2M Devices (D', d) that are attached to this {{object|##.SCL}} instance.
        While discovery and identification of devices by the M2M Gateway or Device (CPE) is implementation specific, each device is represented by an instance of the {{object|.Hosts.Host}} table.
        When the M2M Device is managed by the CWMP endpoint of the CPE, the {{object}} is expected to be referenced by an instance of one of the following tables: 
        *{{object|.ManagementServer.EmbeddedDevice}}

        Section 5.3.5 of the M2M Functional Architecture {{bibref|ETSIM2MFA}} describes the REM functionality expected of a SCL to a M2M Device.
        This object instance provides the administration properties required by a SCL to remotely manage an instance of a M2M Device within a M2M area network. 
        A M2M Device is associated with an instance of a {{object|#.AreaNwkInstance}}. 
        This table contains parameters and information of the M2M Device related to each {{object|#.AreaNwkInstance}} instance.
        Instances of this table are created and deleted by the CPE. The ACS MAY modify the writeable parameters of this object instance but  it is possible that the value set by the ACS is not retained between reboots of the M2M Device.

          The XML file referenced by this URL MUST NOT change while the CPE is running, and SHOULD NOT change across a CPE reboot. Note that {{param|UUID}} is a unique key, so the XML file referenced by this URL will never change.
          The XML file MAY be located within the CPE. In this scenario the CPE MAY use the value of "localhost" as URL host portion, When the "localhost" value is used, the ACS has the responsibility to substitute the "localhost" value with the host portion of the connection request URL.
          Behavior in the event of an invalid URL, failure to access the referenced XML file, or an invalid XML file, is implementation-dependent.

          This parameter is used to control throttling of active notifications sent by the CPE to the ACS.  It defines the  minimum number of {{units}} that the CPE MUST wait since the end of the last session with the ACS before establishing a new session for  the purpose of delivering an active notification.
          In other words, if CPE needs to establish a new session with the ACS for the sole purpose of delivering an active notification, it  MUST delay establishing such a session as needed to ensure that the minimum time since the last session completion has been met.
          The time is counted since the last successfully completed session, regardless of whether or not it was used for active notifications  or other purposes. However, if connection to the ACS is established for purposes other than just delivering active notifications,  including for the purpose of retrying a failed session, such connection MUST NOT be delayed based on this parameter value, and the  pending active notifications MUST be communicated during that connection.
          The time of the last session completion does not need to be tracked across reboots.

"Full JID" entries require an exact match whereas "Bare JID" entries are a wildcard match and will match any Jabber ID with the same local-part and domain-part independent of the resource-part.

        <description>
          When set to {{true}}, forces statistics for the current sample to be calculated and updated in the data model.  Setting it to {{false}} has no effect. {{hidden}}
          If this is the first time that {{param}} has been set to {{true}} during the current sample interval, this MUST cause a new value to be added to each of the periodic statistics comma-separated list parameters, and the {{param|ReportEndTime}} and all {{param|SampleSeconds}} parameters MUST be updated accordingly.
          If this is not the first time that {{param}} has been set to {{true}} during the current sample interval, then the new values that were added as described in the previous paragraph, and the {{param|ReportEndTime}} and all {{param|SampleSeconds}} parameters, MUST be updated accordingly.
          Note that {{param}} just provides a "sneak preview" of the current sample.  It does not create a new sample and it does not interfere with the sample interval schedule.
          At the end of each sample interval, if {{param}} was set to {{true}} during the sample interval then the new values that were added as described above, and the {{param|ReportEndTime}} and all {{param|SampleSeconds}} parameters, will be updated accordingly.  In other words, the partial sample data that was created when {{param}} was set to {{true}} will be updated one last time at the end of the sample interval.
